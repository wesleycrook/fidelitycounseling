                                                Most of our therapists do take insurance from some major insurance companies. You can check on your therapist's individual page to see which insurance plans are accepted. Please bring your insurance card to your first session. </p>
                                                <p>We do bill upfront for anyone using insurance, so many clients find it helpful to know their exact deductible and copay/coinsurance before you come in for your first session. You can get this information by calling the number on the back of your insurance card. Once your insurance company begins to cover your sessions, we will refund you for any over-payments and begin charging your copay/coinsurance according to your insurance plan.

                                                Initial sessions are an opportunity for you and your therapist to get to know each other a little better and determine whether or not you will be a good fit. It is always a good idea to spend some time before your first session thinking through what you hope to gain from therapy and what major issues you'd like to address. If your therapist determines that they cannot adequately provide the care you need, they will discuss with you possible referrals or types of therapies that they believe would be of help to you.
